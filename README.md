# Greetings!
I am Nika. If you are not beginner like me, maybe my written code will look kinda bad for you, so please give me some advices that will be helpful for me. Also, sharing is the best way to learn, so it'll be good for you too. And if you are beginner like me, lets learn together!(Links of my projects are in my resume). Thanks in advance!
